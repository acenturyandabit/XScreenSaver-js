# ruigen
A bunch of quick to include UI bits and pieces.
Demo: http://quotum.herokuapp.com/ruigen
## How to use
1. Include the JS file in a script tag on your page. 
2. Create a div or other container with class='the_filename_of_the_js_you_want'. E.g. for hackertext have class="hackertext"
3. That's... literally it. 
## A few caveats
The script will work better if you include it after your jQuery, if you plan on using jQuery. If you don't explicitly include jQuery the script will get jQuery from a CDN for itself.
